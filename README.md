# Make-Your-Own-Lithium-Power-Banks
Repository containing source files of Demand for Energy Equality's guide on "Make Your Own Lithium Power Banks" in a machine readable format to ease speed of translation and increase accessibility

## Introduction
This repository has taken the content of the ["Make Your Own Lithium Power Banks"](https://www.demandenergyequality.org/make-your-own-power-banks) PDF and put them into a form which can be easily corrected, improved and translated by the community using LaTeX a markdown language for technical topics.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. All the vocabulary from each chapter has been arranged in a way that can be easily learnt from Anki, separated into decks for each chapter.
2. Any updates, corrections or translations to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Make-Your-Own-Lithium-Power-Banks">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Make-Your-Own-Lithium-Power-Banks</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.
3. Modifications from the original work includes typo correction, card merging & consistency consolidation (see the commit history for [en] for the specific changes if any).

Feel free to share the PDFs and give the repository a star so more people are likely to see this work and can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you're just looking for the content, find the relevant PDF file in your language by navigating the folder structure above and click the download button. If you're looking for the source it is. To build these PDFs we have been using Sublime Text with a LaTeX addon to help build it faster, better and more accurately than with other tools but you can use whatever works best for you.

## Potential Improvements Yet to be Made
1. To find a way to systematically pull the content if there are any updates from the original source in the future.
    - Currently this was all done manually.
2. We would like to be able to translate the content for different languages so other people who don't speak English can learn this topic or be able to make textbooks for other languages as well.
3. Turn the content into a set of flashcards to learn about the topic and make it even more accessible to learn & revise.

## Contributing
Pull requests, corrections, translations & fixes are welcome. Any contributions must be submitted under the same license that the original piece of work (see below). Take a look at any open issues or submit new ones if there is something that needs to be fixed or added.

### Translating for other languages
Translations in all languages are welcome. Send a pull request or open an issue any time of day or night.

**Please prepend the tag `[lang-code]` to your issues and pull requests.** For example, `[fr]` for French. This will help everyone pick out things they care about.

We're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one major change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it would be super cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can review them more effectively and/or individually.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) TODO for more guidance and details for making a contribution.
