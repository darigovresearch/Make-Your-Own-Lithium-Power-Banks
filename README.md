We have also been experimenting with a [sphinx-based](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) version [at this URL](https://darigovresearch.github.io/Make-Your-Own-Lithium-Power-Banks/) which may end up being easier to convert to offline pdfs & a more interactive site.

## Potential Improvements Yet to be Made
1. To find a way to systematically pull the content if there are any updates from the original source in the future.
    - Currently this was all done manually.
2. We would like to be able to translate the content for different languages so other people who don't speak English can learn this topic or be able to make textbooks for other languages as well.
3. Turn the content into a set of flashcards to learn about the topic and make it even more accessible to learn & revise.

## Contributing
Pull requests, corrections, translations & fixes are welcome. Any contributions must be submitted under the same license that the original piece of work (see below). Take a look at any open issues or submit new ones if there is something that needs to be fixed or added.

Watch our video on how to contribute to open source for a complete overview -> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWA4wyacY2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWA4wyacY2A)

### Translating for other languages
Translations in all languages are welcome. Send a pull request or open an issue any time of day or night.

**Please prepend the tag `[lang-code]` to your issues and pull requests.** For example, `[fr]` for French. This will help everyone pick out things they care about.

We're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one major change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it would be super cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can review them more effectively and/or individually.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more guidance and details for making a contribution.
