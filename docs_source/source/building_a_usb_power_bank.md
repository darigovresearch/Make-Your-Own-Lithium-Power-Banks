**Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO) -** a very common battery chemistry, used for batteries in phones and laptops and other small portable devices. They have a relatively short life span, low thermal stability and limited power capacity, but have a high energy density and are relatively cheap to make.

**Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) -** found in electric vehicles, grid-scale battery systems, e-bikes, power tools. They have a high power capacity, high energy density, and are more stable than LCO batteries.

**Lithium Manganese Oxide -** mixed with NMC to further increase power capacity.

**Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) -** a very stable lithium chemistry mainly used in 12V battery replacements, cordless tools, and devices that need long lifespans. LiFePO4 cells have a lower nominal voltage and a lower energy density than other lithium chemistries, as well as being more expensive, but they are less susceptible to deterioration when fully charged, and are much safer. 

The chemistry of lithium based cells applies to the cathode, with the anode being generally made of graphite (carbon). The cells are formed in multiple layers and sandwiched into a thin film, usually with an electrolyte-soaked porous separator in the centre and insulating separators on the outside. The film is either rolled into a cylinder and placed into a steel case, or folded and placed into a flat pouch (lithium polymer). Cylindrical cell sizes are designated by their diameter and length in mm, e.g 18-65(0). Lithium polymer (pouch) cells are used to create thin, flat batteries or lightweight batteries used to power drones and other RC vehicles.
