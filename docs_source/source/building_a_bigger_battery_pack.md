# Building a bigger battery pack

A lithium battery pack to be used in higher voltage systems will need to be made up of several cells connected in series. Three lithium-ion cells with a nominal voltage of 3.7V connected in series will have an overall nominal voltage of 11.1V, and 12.6V when fully charged, so can feasibly be used in a 12V system. Seven lithium-ion cells in series will have a nominal voltage of 25.9V and a max voltage of 29.4V, which makes it a good option for 24V systems. It is essential to use a battery management system (BMS) that can keep the individual cells balanced, to avoid individual cells becoming overcharged or undercharged when they are subjected to charge-discharge cycles. It is also essential to ensure that the cells used have similar capacities, which will require a more thorough testing process if using used cells than that described above for making USB power banks. 

While it is possible to build DIY battery packs to use in off grid systems from used 18650 cells connected in series, we do not recommend this unless you have a lot of experience of building off grid systems and working with these kind of cells, since the risks involved are considerable.

If you are looking for lithium batteries to use in 12V renewable energy systems, we would recommend using pre-made lithium battery modules such as those made by TN Power or Victron, which are designed to be ‘drop-in’ replacements for 12V lead-acid batteries. These types of batteries tend to use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cells, which are much more thermally stable and safer to use than lithium-ion cells.
